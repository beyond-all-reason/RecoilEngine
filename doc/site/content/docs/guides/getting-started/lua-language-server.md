Recoil now provides a Lua library that is compatible with [Lua Language Server](https://luals.github.io/), providing type checking and intellisense in your IDE.

### Adding the library to your project

The [recoil-lua-library](https://github.com/beyond-all-reason/recoil-lua-library) package provides type definitions for your editor. This can be added as a submodule to your project (following its usage guide).

### IDE support

When working with Lua, we recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [lua-language-server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sumneko.lua) plugin. See the [Lua Language Server website](https://luals.github.io/#install) for other supported editors.
