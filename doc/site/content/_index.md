> [!NOTE]
> Recoil is a recent hard fork of [Spring](https://github.com/spring/spring) from the [105 tree](https://github.com/spring/spring/releases/tag/105.0.1), many references to it might and will be present. Overall most documented Spring API and tutorials are compatible with Recoil since they are based on the 105 tree.

## Getting started

> [!WARNING]
> This site is an early work-in-progress so content will mostly be references to Spring documentation until its own guides are written.
